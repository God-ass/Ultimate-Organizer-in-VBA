# Ultimate-Organizer-in-VBA

## Problem Statement

The Ultimate Organizer is a project with wide-ranging uses and applications. It is designed to create a VBA user form that allows users to interact with a data table on a main worksheet in several ways:

1. **Add or Delete Categories**: Users can define new categories, which will be added as columns/column headings in the data table.
2. **Add or Delete Records**: Users can add new records (rows in the table) or delete existing ones.
3. **Look Up and Replace Categories**: Users can search through the data and output a specific user-defined category. There is also an option to replace these items.


## About this project

1. **Main Form**: The main form should have options to add a category, delete a category, add a new record (row of a table), delete record, and search through the data (by using one of the categories). A delete confirmation box should appear to confirm deletion of any categories.

2. **Add Category**: If the user wishes to create a new category, a user form similar to the one below should appear. This allows the user to input the name of a new category. This would be the heading of a column of data.

3. **Delete Category**: If the user wishes to delete an entire category (other than the Names category), a user form similar to the one below should appear.

4. **Add Record**: We wish to be able to add records (rows of the table/spreadsheet). A user form similar to the one below should allow the user to input a new record.

5. **Delete Record**: If the user wishes to delete an entire record (row of the spreadsheet, other than the first row), a user form similar to the one below should appear.

6. **Search/Replace**: The final aspect of the project is to allow the user to search through records for information and replace or add information.

7. **Input Validation**: You should make sure that your user form never brings up the “Debug” box and the Visual Basic Editor. There is a lot of input validation and fine tuning that you can do for this project (like what happens if Cancel buttons are pressed, etc.).
